# Narrative Visualization: Exploring Daily Life Across Income Levels

This is a final project for the CS 416: Data Visualization course at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2025 Summer.

This interactive narrative visualization explores how daily household items—specifically toothbrushes, beds, and family portraits—vary across countries and income levels using images from Dollar Street by Gapminder (https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street).

The project follows the Martini Glass structure: it begins with a guided narrative and transitions into exploratory interactions, where users can filter by income and region, and click on images to view additional details including geographic maps.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- D3.js (https://d3js.org)
- TopoJSON
- GeoJSON World Map

## Features

- Sequential scenes guiding users through toothbrushes, beds, and families
- Scene annotations
- Income and region filters for exploration
- Image popups with contextual information and a world map
- Tooltips for additional metadata
